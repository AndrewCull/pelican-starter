    <h1>Resources Needed</h1>
<ol>
<li>Text Editor (VIM or Atom are my favorites)</li>
</ol>
<h1>Knowledge Required</h1>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax" title="Markown Syntax">Markdown</a></li>
</ol>
<p>This entire guide is written in Markdown, a shorthand syntax that allows us to style things like links, lists, and images through the browser style guides instead of the document itself.  Markdown is really handy and you don't have to know much about it to be effective.</p>
<h2>A short guide on Markdown Syntax</h2>
<p>Markdown was invented to take a whole lot of code out of your content which makes it useful since you can focus only on content. It goes like this:</p>
<h1>This is a top level heading</h1>
<h2>This is a second level heading</h2>
<h3>Hopefully you have the idea on this H3</h3>
<p>Paragraph text doesn't need formating, however some typographic formatting is available:
<strong>bold text</strong>
<em>italic text</em></p>
<h3>Lists</h3>
<p>Lists are simple as well. An unordered list starts like this:
- list item 1
- list item 2
- list item 3</p>
<p>If you want an ordered list, write the numbers:
1. list item 1
2. list item 2
3. list item 3</p>
<h3>Quotes</h3>
<p>Blockquotes are also simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a blockquote, it has a '&gt;' before it. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Images</h3>
<p>Images can be easily inserted like this:  <img alt="Bill Murray" src="http://www.fillmurray.com/300/300" />. Relative URLS are those hosted by Agema's own site, which sit in the 'images' directory.  Those are referenced by <img alt="Alt Text" src="./images/bowhunting_selfie.jpg" />.</p>
<h3>Links</h3>
<p>Finally, links are a little tricky.  If you have an external link, you start with the text, followed by the address and title of the link. <a href="https://www.agema.io" title="Agema Corporation Website">Agema Corporation</a></p>
<h2>File Naming</h2>
<p>We use text files saved as the following:  'title.md' ('.md' stands for markdown)</p>
<h2>File format</h2>
<p>You will notice that there are some headings on the top of the page which provide critical information for our static site builder.</p>
<p>title: This is the Title of the Article
date: 2016-03-21 (note format of YYYY-MM-DD)
categories: leadership, management, culture, product development, book club, marketing, sales (pick which ones and include those, users can click into groups of articles by category)
authors: Andrew Cull (Your name, first and last. If you have multiple authors, then names separated by a comma. Eg 'Andrew Cull, Kristina Netzler, Craig Allan, Phoebi Crawford'
summary: A summary of what the article is about.
tldr: Stands for 'To Long Didn't Read'. We include this at the end of the article if people want the gist only.</p>
<h2>A Short Guide on Writing</h2>
<p>Consider the following:
- Who the content is for?
- Why you are writing it?
- What you will consider a success and how you will measure it?</p>
<p>What do you want the reader to:
1. Understand
2. Know
3. Do</p>
<h1>Process</h1>
<ol>
<li>Submit your idea and short explanation on the project management system.</li>
<li>One member of the team approves your idea and moves to "Approved".</li>
<li>Write your first draft.</li>
<li>One team member reviews and edits your draft for structure, content, grammar, etc.</li>
<li>Submit final draft to website manager for deployment.</li>
<li>Once deployed, blast out to social media using <a href="https://buffer.com" title="Buffer.io">Buffer</a></li>
</ol>
<h1>Standards</h1>
<ol>
<li>Titles should be catchy and provide a clear hint on the content, readers question, or outcome.</li>
<li>We use long-form blogs that provide value on their own, 2,000 words or more is ideal.</li>
<li>Write in an active voice: "The team climbed to the summit" <em>not</em> "The summit was climbed by the team".</li>
<li>Images must be formatted as either .jpg or .png.</li>
</ol>
